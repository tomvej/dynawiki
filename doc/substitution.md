Substitutions
=============
There are several common characters which are difficult to write on the keyboard,
therefore typographically incorrect substitutes are used, e.g. `--` instead of &mdash; (em dash),
or `...` instead of &hellip; (ellipsis).

When the user types one of the following characters sequences (consecutively optionally with backspace), 
a substitute is used:
* `...` to &hellip;
* `--` to &mdash;
