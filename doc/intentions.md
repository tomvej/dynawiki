Intentions
==========
Intentions is something Intellij Idea uses. When you press `alt+return`,
a popup appears offering what could be done with the selection (whether
it is collapsed or not).
 
Idea uses this to offer refactoring, etc., however, we could use it to change
block or inline style and other things.

> **Why Intentions?**
> 
> Why not use buttons or another means of user input? The goal is to make it possible to
> control the editor only via the keyboard. Another benefit of intentions is only those
> applicable need to be displayed.

> **What intentions**
>
> It would seem nice to use intentions for everything, however, the context menu may become 
> too cluttered for the user to orientate in it. Thus, it makes sense to only include such
> actions which would be too tedious to do otherwise (or would be outright impossible).
